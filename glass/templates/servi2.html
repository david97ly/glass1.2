 <p class="lead">
Given the expanded dimensions of the glass on the front of trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles, not to mention their frequent use in high-traffic areas and construction zones, it’s easy to see why these large-scale vehicles can be particularly prone to windshield chips and cracks. While you shouldn’t assume you need a whole new front window every time your windshield is damaged, you should have each and every defect inspected and treated by a qualified auto glass company. In most cases, Master Auto Glass Corp. can close off the crack and seal it with a specialized epoxy resin in a matter of minutes. If the severity of the damage warrants an entirely new windshield, our auto glass specialists can help with that as well. We’ll be happy to explain the situation in detail, write you up a price quote, and get started on your truck windshield replacement just as soon as you give us the go ahead.  </p>
